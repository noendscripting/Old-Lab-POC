# xAdcsDeployment

The **xAdcsDeployment** DSC resources have been specifically tested as a method to populate a Certificate Services server role on Windows Server 2012 R2 after the Certificate Services role and the Web Enrollment feature have been enabled.
Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is used to create certification authorities and related role services that allow you to issue and manage certificates used in a variety of applications. 

## Scenario

Certificates are widely used to establish trust relationships between computers.
This DSC resource can be used to address some of the most common scenarios including the need for a Stand-Alone Certificate Authority or an Active Directory Trusted Root Certificate Authority and the Certificate Services website for users to submit and complete certificate requests. 

In a specific example, when building out a web server workload such as an internal website that provides confidential information to be accessed from computers that are members of an Active Directory domain, AD CS can provide a source for the SSL certificats that will automatically be trusted.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Add a Certificate Authority and configure it for AD CS and Web Enrollment. 

This example will add the Windows Server Roles and Features to support a Certificate Authority and configure it to provide AD CS and Web Enrollment.

```powershell
Configuration CertificateAuthority
{        
    Node ‘NodeName’ 
    {  
    	WindowsFeature ADCS-Cert-Authority
        {
               Ensure = 'Present'
               Name = 'ADCS-Cert-Authority'
        }
        xADCSCertificationAuthority ADCS
        {
            Ensure = 'Present'
            Credential = $Node.Credential
            CAType = 'EnterpriseRootCA'
            DependsOn = '[WindowsFeature]ADCS-Cert-Authority'              
        }
        WindowsFeature ADCS-Web-Enrollment
        {
            Ensure = 'Present'
            Name = 'ADCS-Web-Enrollment'
            DependsOn = '[WindowsFeature]ADCS-Cert-Authority'
        }
        xADCSWebEnrollment CertSrv
        {
            Ensure = 'Present'
            Name = 'CertSrv'
            Credential = $Node.Credential
            DependsOn = '[WindowsFeature]ADCS-Web-Enrollment','[xADCSCertificationAuthority]ADCS'
        } 
    }  
} 
```

#### Example 2: Remove the AD CS functionality from a server. 

```powershell
Configuration RetireCertificateAuthority
{        
    Node ‘NodeName’ 
    {  
        xADCSWebEnrollment CertSrv
        {
            Ensure = 'Absent'
            Name = 'CertSrv'
        }
	    WindowsFeature ADCS-Web-Enrollment
        {
            Ensure = 'Absent'
            Name = 'ADCS-Web-Enrollment'
            DependsOn = '[xADCSWebEnrollment]CertSrv'
        }
        xADCSCertificationAuthority ADCS
        {
            Ensure = 'Absent'
            DependsOn = '[WindowsFeature]ADCS-Web-Enrollment'              
        }
	    WindowsFeature ADCS-Cert-Authority
        {
            Ensure = 'Absent'
            Name = 'ADCS-Cert-Authority'
            DependsOn = ‘[xADCSCertificationAuthority]ADCS’
        }        
    }  
}
```
